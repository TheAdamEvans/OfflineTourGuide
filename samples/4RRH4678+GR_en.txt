# Australia's Most Wholesome Pedestrian Crossing

**Little Bourke Street, Surry Hills**

Right, so we're standing in front of a pedestrian crossing painted with cats. Yes, cats. Welcome to Surry Hills, where someone on the local council clearly won their campaign for "Sydney's most unnecessary but utterly delightful infrastructure project."

This is Gadigal land, where the Eora people walked these ridgelines long before anyone paved roads or painted crosswalks with felines. The name "Surry Hills" itself is colonial — named after a place in England by homesick settlers who never quite understood they'd landed somewhere already named, already known, already loved for tens of thousands of years.

**It's November**, 25°C with that sticky harbor humidity. Sunset's around 7:50pm, but honestly, you're here for five minutes of pure charm, not an epic daylight adventure. This isn't the Sistine Chapel. It's a cat crossing. Let's keep perspective.

## How This Happened

In 2019, Surry Hills local Georgia Broadway started a petition asking the City of Sydney to paint cat paws on the pedestrian crossing near the Bourke Street Bakery. The area had long been known for its stray cat population — fed and cared for by locals, photographed by Instagram tourists, generally tolerated in that very Australian way we accept wildlife that doesn't actively try to kill us.

The council, shockingly, said yes. For about $4,000, they painted 75 white cat paw prints along the existing zebra stripes. It took two hours. It became an international news story. Sydney, in a nutshell: we'll debate harbor bridge tolls for decades but approve novelty crosswalks with shocking efficiency.

**Local truth**: The stray cats are mostly gone now. Desexing programs and adoption drives cleared them out around 2021. The crossing remains as a memorial to feral felines that once ruled this stretch of terrace houses and cafes. Very Sydney — we memorialize things that annoyed us while they were here.

## What You're Actually Looking At

Standard zebra crossing with white paw prints painted alongside the stripes. It's about 6 meters wide. Takes 8 seconds to cross at a normal pace. Double that if you're stopping for photos, which everyone does. Cars wait patiently. This is Surry Hills — drivers expect pedestrians to dawdle for aesthetic reasons.

The crossing sits between Bourke Street Bakery (excellent sourdough, prepare to queue) and a row of Victorian-era terrace houses now converted to apartments and galleries. The neighborhood's gentrified — once working-class Irish and Lebanese, now design studios and $7 flat whites.

Look for the street art on surrounding walls. Surry Hills has some of Sydney's best legal graffiti, especially along Foster, Foveaux, and Reservoir Streets. The Gadigal street art mural nearby acknowledges traditional ownership with much more substance than this tourist crossing.

## Getting Here

Central Station is 10 minutes' walk — exit through the Chalmers Street exit, head east on Cleveland, then north on Crown. Bus 301, 302, or 303 from the city drops you on Cleveland Street (5-minute walk). If you're already in Surry Hills exploring, just ask literally anyone under 40 where the cat crossing is. Everyone knows.

**Insider tip**: Don't make a special trip just for this. Seriously. It's cute for 90 seconds. Combine it with actually exploring Surry Hills — this neighborhood has the best coffee, vintage shops, and laneway art in Sydney. The crossing is the excuse, not the destination.

## Eating in Surry Hills (The Real Reason You're Here)

Bourke Street Bakery right here does lamingtons and sausage rolls that'll ruin you for inferior versions forever. $6-8. Expect queues on weekend mornings. Single Origin Roasters on Little Buckingham Street is where serious coffee people go — espresso blends they roast on-site. $4.50.

For lunch, Spice Alley (5 minutes south on Kensington Street) is an outdoor Asian hawker center with Malaysian laksa, Singaporean chicken rice, and Thai boat noodles. $12-16. Locals eat here midweek when tourists haven't found it yet.

Or walk to Riley Street (3 minutes east) where the old Italian and Lebanese shops still hold out against cocktail bars. Artelatte does proper Italian coffee with biscotti. Corretto does natural wine by the glass and cicchetti. You're spoiled for choice, honestly.

## The Thing About Surry Hills

This neighborhood used to be rough. Like, properly rough — poverty, crime, riots in the 1920s. Lebanese and Greek migrants arrived mid-century and built the textile workshops that still occupy warehouses behind these Victorian terraces. Then artists and gays moved in during the '80s when rent was cheap. Now it's boutique hotels and hatted restaurants.

The cat crossing is peak late-gentrification Sydney — quirky public art that signals a neighborhood has fully transitioned from working-class grit to "funky" destination. It's harmless. It's cute. It erases nothing and preserves nothing. It's... a crosswalk with cats.

But the neighborhood itself? Still worth exploring. Just dig past the Instagram surface.

## What Else Is Close?

Walk south 5 minutes to Prince Alfred Park — 6.6 hectares of green space with a heated outdoor pool (free entry, open October-March). Or head north 7 minutes and you're in Paddington, where Victorian terrace houses come with iron lacework balconies and more money than god.

My move? Walk east along Crown Street toward Oxford. Stop at the small bars (dive bars, wine bars, cocktail bars), check out the vintage clothing shops, and understand Sydney's inner-city culture better than any harbor postcard will teach you.

Alright, take your photo. Wait for the lights. Cross like a cat — independent, slightly aloof, questioning why humans do anything. Welcome to Surry Hills.
