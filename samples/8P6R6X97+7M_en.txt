# 📿 Giant Wild Goose Pagoda – Xuanzang's Final 64 Meters

**Yanta District, Great Ci'en Temple**

Everyone, see that square seven-story pagoda? In 652 CE, Master Xuanzang personally supervised its construction. He carried back 657 Buddhist scriptures from India, walked 17 years, over 50,000 kilometers, just to bring these texts safely back to Chang'an. This pagoda is his study, and his final wish.

We stand on Great Ci'en Temple's foundation—this was a Tang Dynasty imperial temple, built by Emperor Taizong Li Shimin for his mother Empress Wende. "Ci'en" (compassionate grace)—an emperor's longing for his mother, written in stone.

**November afternoon**, sunlight slants across the pagoda body, illuminating those cracks left by years especially clearly. Now 15°C, wind a bit strong, climbing to the top will be colder—don't forget your scarf. Sunset is 5:40 PM, square's music fountain starts at 7 PM (only summer-autumn, winter stopped, pity).

## Why Called "Wild Goose Pagoda"?

The name has a gentle legend. Buddhist sutras say a flock of wild geese flew past, one goose fell and died before monks, monks grateful for goose's sacrifice built a pagoda to commemorate. But I prefer another explanation—Xuanzang saw similar pagodas at Nalanda Temple in India, after returning drew from memory, craftsmen looking at drawings said: "This pagoda looks like a southward-flying wild goose." So it was called that.

The pagoda originally had only five stories, during Wu Zetian's period added to ten, later collapsed, Ming Dynasty rebuilt to current seven stories. Each story carved with inscriptions from literati through ages, most precious is Cen Shen's "Climbing Ci'en Temple Pagoda"—"Pagoda势如涌出,孤高耸天宫." 1,300-year-old poem carved on 1,300-year-old brick, stand here and recite it, time will pause.

## Climb, or Not Climb?

64 meters, wooden ladder, steep! Elderly and children need to assess stamina. But the reward for climbing is 360° overlooking Xi'an—north Qinling Mountains like a screen, south Tang Dynasty Chang'an city layout (yes, you can see the checkerboard), east modern high-rises, west Tang Dynasty Sleepless City's antique building complex.

**Insiders know**: Inside每层都有Xuanzang's journey murals, third floor has Xuanzang's footprint stone carving (legend says he brought back "Buddha's footprint" from India), fourth floor has traces of wooden frames that once stored scriptures—those grooves in walls are memories left by mortise-and-tenon structures.

Ticket ¥50 (includes temple), climbing pagoda additional ¥30. Suggest coming 3-4 PM, best light, half the tourists, no queue for photos.

## What Xuanzang Didn't Tell You

Temple has Xuanzang Tripitaka Hall, inside are his skull relics—this is real, excavated in Nanjing 1942, 1949 part分给Xi'an. Looking at that tiny relic box, thinking of the 50,000 kilometers he walked—Gobi, snow mountains, bandits, disease—suddenly understand what "vow-power" means.

Pagoda's west base has a stele forest carving "进士题名"—Tang Dynasty newly-passed jinshi scholars had to come here to inscribe their names after passing, equivalent to posting on social media to celebrate. Bai Juyi passed jinshi at 27, excitedly wrote "Ci'en Pagoda inscription place, of seventeen I'm the youngest"—youthful spirit leaps from stone.

Temple's ginkgo trees are golden yellow in November, ground covered in golden leaves, stepping on them makes rustling sounds. Forbidden City has palace red, Great Ci'en Temple has ginkgo yellow—this is Chang'an autumn's correct color scheme.

## Eating at Yanta

Exit south gate, don't enter景区餐厅. Walk west 5 minutes to Cuihua Road, duck into "Wei Family Cold Noodles" (chain but authentic), sesame cold noodles ¥8, noodles chewy, sesame sauce thick, pair with their Bingfeng soda (Xi'an people's happy water), amazing.

Or go underground at North Square to "Xi'an Restaurant," though pricier (¥80 per person average), but gourd chicken (whole chicken steamed, boiled, fried, crispy outside tender inside) and warm-mixed kidney strips are century-old signature dishes, Shaanxi cuisine's ceiling.

Want late-night snack? Tang Dynasty Sleepless City pedestrian street (exit is right there) lights up till 11 PM, has "Tumbler Lady" performance art, plus various snack stalls—roujiamo, rolled noodles, persimmon cakes, mirror cakes—walk and eat, too happy.

## After Xuanzang, Where Next?

800 meters north is Shaanxi History Museum, must-visit, book online in advance (free but must grab tickets). Or 2 kilometers south is Tang Paradise, imitation Tang garden architecture, evening lights brilliant, good for photos.

My personal suggestion? Just sit in the temple. Find a stone bench under a tree, look at pagoda, imagine Xuanzang sitting here translating scriptures—outside the window Tang Dynasty's noisy traffic, inside the room Sanskrit's difficult obscurity—he completed the last sutra at 64, passed away the next year. This pagoda, he exchanged with his remaining life.

Alright, before entering silence phone, this is Buddhist temple, speak softly. Climbing pagoda watch your step, wooden ladder a bit slippery. Let's go, Xuanzang waits to tell his story!
