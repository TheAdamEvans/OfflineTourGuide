The Pagoda That Housed Buddhist Scriptures From India

I always tell people: if you only climb one tower in Xi'an, make it this one. Not because it's the tallest—it isn't—but because the view from the top shows you exactly why this city mattered for 1,400 years. You can see the grid layout of ancient Chang'an, the Qinling Mountains to the south, and on clear days, the shimmer of the Wei River to the north.

We're in Yanta District, late October, about 15°C with autumn light that photographers dream about. Sunset's at 6:15pm, and the pagoda's shadow stretches impossibly long across the plaza. Come around 4pm for the best light, or early morning at 8am when tourist buses haven't arrived yet.

This is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda—Da Yan Ta in Chinese—built in 652 CE during the Tang Dynasty. The monk Xuanzang, who walked to India and back (yes, walked—17 years, 25,000 kilometers), needed a fireproof place to store the Buddhist sutras he'd carried home. The original pagoda was five stories. It collapsed. They rebuilt it at seven stories in 704 CE, and that's what you're looking at now: 64 meters of brick, slightly tilted from earthquakes, still standing after 1,300 years.

The area around us was once the Ci'en Temple complex, built by Emperor Gaozong in memory of his mother. In Tang times, this temple covered 340 acres and had 13 courtyards. Monks chanted here, pilgrims came from Korea and Japan to study, and the imperial court held ceremonies. Now it's mostly gone, rebuilt in miniature, but the pagoda remains—the original structure, never rebuilt, just repaired.

Xuanzang himself supervised the construction. He was already famous by then—his journey to India had made him a legend. He'd crossed deserts, mountains, kingdoms, debated with scholars, met kings. He returned with 657 Buddhist texts, and spent the rest of his life translating them from Sanskrit to Chinese. Without him, Chinese Buddhism would look completely different.

Climb the pagoda—it's ¥30 for the grounds, another ¥40 to climb. The staircase is steep and narrow, wooden steps worn smooth by millions of feet. Each floor has windows facing the four directions. Stop at each level. The city reveals itself in layers: modern Xi'an first, then the Tang-era street grid underneath, then the distant mountains that ringed ancient Chang'an.

At the top, you're 64 meters up. The wind hits different here. You can see the Big Wild Goose Pagoda North Square below—massive public plaza with Asia's largest musical fountain (free shows at 12pm, 4pm, and 9pm). Beyond that, the sprawl of modern Xi'an. To the south, Qinling Mountains, the natural southern boundary of the Guanzhong Plain. This is what Xuanzang saw when he returned home in 645 CE: mountains, walls, and the capital of the world's most powerful empire.

Inside the pagoda, each floor has small exhibits—stone carvings, Buddhist statues, old photos. The second floor shows images of Xuanzang's journey. The fourth floor has Tang Dynasty calligraphy. It's not spectacular, but it's authentic—this is what the pagoda was built for, housing texts and images.

After you climb down, walk around the temple grounds. The Ci'en Temple itself is worth 20 minutes—the main hall has a large statue of Xuanzang, looking surprisingly young. The temple is active; you'll see monks and locals burning incense. The scent of sandalwood mixes with autumn leaves.

For food, skip the expensive restaurants right at the entrance. Walk 10 minutes south to Yanta West Road Food Street. Look for "Zhang's Hand-pulled Noodles"—biang biang noodles (wide as a belt, ¥18), topped with chili oil, vinegar, and chopped vegetables. The character for "biang" is one of the most complex in Chinese—57 strokes—and no one agrees on how to write it. Ask them to show you.

Or try "Muslim Li's Lamb Soup"—milky white broth simmered for 8 hours, ¥25, served with fresh baked flatbread. You tear the bread into pieces yourself and drop it into the soup. It's soul food, especially on cold days.

Timing matters here. Weekends get crowded—the plaza fills with families, street performers, and tour groups. Weekdays are calmer. Early morning (before 9am) or late afternoon (after 4pm) are best. The pagoda is lit up at night—golden lights against dark sky—beautiful but you can't climb after 6pm.

The musical fountain shows are popular but honestly? They're fine. Water choreographed to music, colorful lights, big crowds. If you're here anyway, watch from the side. If you're not, don't make a special trip.

From here, the Bell Tower is 4km north—easy taxi ride or take bus 609. The Muslim Quarter (Huimin Street) is just beyond that, perfect for dinner. Or walk 15 minutes east to the Shaanxi History Museum—one of China's best, and free with advance reservation. The museum closes at 5:30pm, so plan accordingly.

What I love about this pagoda: it's not reconstructed, not "restored to former glory" with new materials. It's the real thing, leaning slightly, bricks dark with age, still doing what it was built to do—standing as a reminder of when Xi'an was the center of the world and monks walked across continents to bring back sacred texts.

Xuanzang died in 664 CE, twelve years after the pagoda was completed. His translations filled 1,335 volumes. The texts he carried back from India formed the foundation of Chinese Buddhism. The pagoda he built to house them still stands, tilting slightly eastward, waiting for you to climb it.
