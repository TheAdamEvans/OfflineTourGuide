# 👑 Daming Palace – Shadow of Flourishing Tang, Pride of Chang'an

**Xincheng District, Daming Palace National Heritage Park**

Everyone, see this vast open field before you? Don't be disappointed. In the 7th-10th centuries CE, this was the center of the world—17 Tang Dynasty emperors handled state affairs here, and for 220 years, edicts issued from this place changed the fate of half of Asia.

Now you can only see rammed earth foundations and outlines of reconstructed buildings, but close your eyes and imagine: Hanyuan Hall rising 15 meters above ground, an area equal to 11 basketball courts, 72 massive columns supporting glazed tile roofs, and on both sides of the imperial path before the great hall, envoys from all nations lined up in two rows, heads bowed to hear the proclamation—this was "tribute from all nations."

We stand at the highest point of Tang Dynasty Chang'an, Longshou Plain. This loess plateau once belonged to nomadic Rong and Di peoples, later as Chinese civilization expanded northward, this became the imperial heartland. The Tang built palaces here both for practicality (high terrain, good drainage) and symbolism (overlooking the realm).

**Now it's early autumn September**, 24°C, high sky with light clouds, autumn grass beginning to yellow. Sunset at 7 PM. The heritage park is huge (3.5 square kilometers, equivalent to 4.5 Forbidden Cities). I recommend renting a bicycle (¥30/hour) or taking the sightseeing cart (¥30/person, hop on/off). Walking will exhaust you.

## Reading Flourishing Tang from Ruins

Hanyuan Hall ruins are the essence. Standing on the reconstructed foundation (original site, accurate height), look south—the imperial path extends straight for 2 kilometers, leading directly to Vermillion Bird Gate (main gate of Tang Chang'an). Imagine newly-appointed officials, foreign envoys, regional governors walking this road, getting closer and closer, the great hall looming larger and larger. In their hearts, was it awe or fear?

**Archaeological discoveries**: Beneath Hanyuan Hall foundation lies a massive drainage system. Tang engineers designed a network of precisely-graded ceramic pipes—no matter how heavy the rainstorm, no flooding. The marble stairs came from Lantian (30 kilometers away), each block weighing 3 tons, hauled by human labor and rolling logs. The power of flourishing Tang showed first in infrastructure.

Linde Hall ruins are more interesting—where the emperor banqueted officials and foreign guests, three connected halls seating 3,000 people dining simultaneously. Excavations unearthed Persian silver plates, Arabic glass cups, bronze mirrors from Japanese envoys—Daming Palace banquets were carnivals of the Silk Road.

##震撼 in the Museum

The ruins museum (included in ticket) absolutely don't skip. The treasure is the 1:15 scale model of Daming Palace—over 200 buildings, Taiye Pond, Penglai Mountain, palace walls, palace gates, detailed down to every pillar. After seeing the model, then viewing the ruins, your brain can automatically complete those vanished palaces.

There's also a micro-film (15 minutes, free) narrating Daming Palace's 200 years from construction to destruction. Huang Chao's rebellion—that fire burned for three days, reducing the world's most luxurious palace complex to ashes, so terrible even court historians couldn't bear to record details. At film's end, scorched earth, music stops, audience falls silent.

The archaeological exhibition hall displays excavated ridge beast tiles, painted bricks, glazed tile ends, gold hairpins and silver ornaments—these fragments can't reassemble complete palaces, but prove that glory truly existed.

## Don't Just See Buildings, See Nature

Taiye Pond ruins are now an artificial lake. Summer brings lotus blossoms, autumn golden reeds, winter migratory birds resting here on their southern flight (mallards, gray herons, egrets all present). Tang Dynasty Taiye Pond was formed by channeling water from Longshou Canal. Poets wrote "watching the moon by Taiye Pond's edge," emperors here boating, watching fish, daydreaming—in gaps between power, also an ordinary person.

The park planted many ancient trees—scholar trees, white pines, ginkgos. Autumn leaves cover the ruins in sheets of gold, especially good for photos. But please don't climb the foundations—those are cultural relics, every inch of earth beneath your feet might bury Tang Dynasty secrets.

## Practical Suggestions

Opens 9 AM, stops admitting visitors 5 PM (closes 6 PM). Ticket ¥60 (half price students), includes ruins and museum. Recommended visit time 3-4 hours.

Metro Line 4 Hanyuan Hall Station, exit directly to south gate (reconstructed Danfeng Gate, very magnificent, good for photos). Or take bus 2 or 262 to Daming Palace National Heritage Park stop.

With children, Danfeng Gate has "Archaeological Exploration Center" where kids experience simulated excavation, find "treasures" they can take home (replica pottery shards), educational and fun—kids don't want to leave.

## Eating Outside the Heritage Park

Inside only small shops, expensive with few choices. Exit east gate (Xuanwu Gate), directly across is Taihua Road food street, all kinds of Shaanxi noodles and snacks clustered together.

Recommend "Lao Bai's Roujiamo" (¥15, so much meat it won't close), with a bowl of hot and sour soup (¥8, Xi'an version not spicy, thick meatball vegetable soup, warms stomach), or "Yongfeng Qishan Noodles" (¥18, Qishan saozi noodles, sour-spicy-fresh-fragrant, broth stewed with dozens of spices).

Want something better for dinner? Take metro to Bell Tower Muslim Quarter, 30 minutes, lamb pita bread soup, soup dumplings, zeng gao, jing gao—the whole spread, eat and wander till midnight.

## Where Next?

3 kilometers south is Giant Wild Goose Pagoda and Furong Garden. 5 kilometers north is Dahua 1935 (old factory converted to cultural creative park, coffee shops and bookstores very literary).

My personal suggestion? Just stay in the park longer. Rent a bike, slowly ride around Taiye Pond, watch wind blow through reeds, watch birds skim across water. Daming Palace is already ruins, but autumn wind, setting sun, loess foundations—these elements combined are more moving than intact palaces.

Some glory can only truly be understood after it's lost. We can't reclaim the radiance of flourishing Tang, but standing on this land, feeling that pride and melancholy—that's already the best memorial.

Alright, enter through security, large bags need storage (free). Bring water and hat, not much shade. Let's go see what "Nine Heavens' palace gates open wide, ten thousand nations' robes and caps bow to the crown" really meant!
