Daming Palace: Where Grass Grows Over Empire

This is going to disappoint you at first. You'll arrive expecting grand buildings and find... foundations. Dirt mounds. Interpretive signs explaining what used to be here. But give it ten minutes. Let your imagination fill in the gaps. Because what stood here from 663 to 904 CE was the administrative heart of the Tang Dynasty—the government complex that ruled half of Asia for 250 years.

We're in Xincheng District on Longshou Plain, early September, about 24°C with autumn light just starting to turn golden. Sunset's at 7pm. The park is massive—3.5 square kilometers, bigger than four Forbidden Cities combined. Rent a bike (¥30/hour) or take the sightseeing cart (¥30, hop on/off). Walking it will exhaust you.

The Tang Dynasty chose this high ground deliberately. Longshou Plateau rises above the rest of Chang'an, offering natural drainage, defensive advantage, and symbolic dominance. Seventeen Tang emperors governed from here. Foreign envoys from Persia, Arabia, Korea, and Japan traveled months to reach these halls. When they stood in front of Hanyuan Hall—the main audience chamber—they would have seen 72 massive columns holding up a roof covered in glazed tiles, the whole structure elevated 15 meters above the plaza. It must have been terrifying.

Now? Foundations. But stand on the reconstructed Hanyuan Hall platform (built to exact historical height on the original site) and look south. The imperial path stretches 2 kilometers in a straight line, leading directly to Zhuque Gate, the main entrance to Tang Chang'an. Imagine walking that path as a provincial governor, getting closer and closer, the hall looming larger. Every step a reminder of imperial power.

The archaeology here is fascinating. Beneath Hanyuan Hall, engineers found an elaborate drainage system—ceramic pipes graded precisely to channel water away, ensuring the foundation never flooded. The marble steps came from Lantian, 30 kilometers away—each block weighing 3 tons, hauled by human labor. The scale of construction was absurd, even by imperial standards.

Linde Hall ruins are equally impressive. This was the banquet hall, three connected pavilions that could seat 3,000 guests dining simultaneously. Excavations turned up Persian silver plates, Arabic glass, Japanese bronze mirrors—evidence that Daming Palace parties were Silk Road gatherings, not just Chinese affairs.

The museum (included in your ticket) is essential. There's a 1:15 scale model of the entire palace complex—over 200 buildings, Taiye Pond, Penglai Mountain, walls, gates. Seeing the model before exploring the ruins helps your brain reconstruct what's missing. There's also a 15-minute film about the palace's destruction during the Huang Chao Rebellion in 880 CE. The fire burned for three days. Entire libraries, artworks, and records turned to ash. The audience always leaves that screening in silence.

Taiye Pond is now an artificial lake, home to migratory birds—mallards, gray herons, egrets. In Tang times, this pond was fed by the Longshou Canal. Emperors boated here, held moon-viewing parties, and occasionally escaped palace politics for an hour of normalcy. The Tang poet Bai Juyi wrote about watching the moon's reflection ripple across Taiye Pond's surface. That same moon reflects here now, onto water that's technically new but occupies the same depression in the earth.

Autumn is when the park shines. Ginkgo leaves turn golden and blanket the ruins. It's almost too beautiful—nature reclaiming empire, grass and trees growing over what was once the most powerful government complex in the world. There's a lesson in that, though I'm not sure what it is. Impermanence, maybe. Or resilience.

Admission is ¥60 (student discount available), open 9am-6pm. Metro Line 4 drops you at Hanyuan Hall Station, right at the south gate (Danfeng Gate, newly reconstructed and stunning). The park has an "Archaeological Discovery Center" where kids can participate in mock excavations and find replica pottery shards to take home. It's surprisingly well-done.

Food options inside are limited and expensive. Exit the east gate (Xuanwu Gate) and cross to Taihua Road—noodle shops, roujiamo stands, hot-and-sour soup. "Lao Bai's Roujiamo" (¥15) is solid, meat piled so high the bread barely closes. Pair it with a bowl of meatball soup (¥8, not spicy despite the name) and you're set.

From here, the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda is 3km south. Or head 5km north to Dahua 1935, an old factory turned cultural park with coffee shops and bookstores. But honestly? Just rent a bike and ride slowly around Taiye Pond. Let the wind blow through the reeds. Watch birds skim the water. The Tang Dynasty is gone, but autumn wind, loess earth, and afternoon light remain. Sometimes that's enough.

What strikes me every time I visit: power is temporary. The Tang ruled for 300 years, commanded armies, built palaces, influenced cultures across Asia. Now it's grass and foundations. But the land endures. The sky looks the same. And people still come here, trying to imagine what it felt like when these ruins were the center of the world.
