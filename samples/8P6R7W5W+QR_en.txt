# 🔔 Bell Tower – Xi'an's Heart and Timekeeper

**Beilin District, East-West-South-North Four Streets Junction**

Everyone, look up! This square building with green glazed tile roof is Xi'an's landmark—Bell Tower. Built Ming Hongwu 17th year (1384), originally 2km west (Guangji Street), 1582 moved entirely to current position. Yes, entirely! Dismantled into over 8,000 wood pieces, numbered, transported, reassembled, not one nail used, all mortise-and-tenon structure, ancient craftsmen's hardcore skills.

We stand at Xi'an's geometric center—four streets east-west-south-north cross here, like giant crossroads. Tang Dynasty Chang'an city designed this way, checkerboard layout, longitude-latitude clear, Bell Tower is board's tengen, controlling whole situation.

**Now December afternoon**, biting cold wind, 5°C, but sun很好. Sunset 5:30, suggest evening visit, setting sun gilds Bell Tower golden, especially beautiful. Night scene more绝, lights on, entire tower like golden treasure box floating above traffic.

## This Tower "Walks"

Early Ming Dynasty, Xi'an city contracted (Tang Chang'an too big, Ming population couldn't支撑), original site Bell Tower at new city west side, not central enough. Emperor ordered: Move! Craftsmen numbered every beam, every brick, reassembled at new site like Lego, error not exceeding 5cm.

After moving, tower 36m high, three-tier eaves, four sides all have arch gates, east-south-west-north corresponding to four streets. Standing below looking up, double-eave dougong layers stacked, like blooming wooden lotus—this is Chinese ancient architecture's proudest decorative technique, not just beautiful, also distributes roof weight, earthquake-resistant.

**Tower Secret**: Second floor has Ming Dynasty iron bell, 5 tons weight, originally hung atop for timekeeping, but sound didn't carry far (iron bell sound muffled), later换了 bronze bell, iron bell retired, now quietly stays in tower, covered in verdigris, witnessing years.

## Climbing Value

Ticket ¥35 (Bell Tower + Drum Tower combo ¥50, suggest buying together). Climb up, wooden stairs steep, hold handrail.

After reaching top, 360° viewing platform, four sides all stories. Look east, Ming city wall east gate; look south, busy traffic straight to Giant Wild Goose Pagoda; look west, Drum Tower and Muslim Quarter; look north, old city gray tiles连绵, full of life's smoke-and-fire气.

Tower interior second floor has bronze bell performance (daily 6 shows: 9:10/10:30/11:30/14:30/15:30/16:30, holidays add shows), costumed performers use replica Warring States bronze bells playing "Jasmine Flower" "Spring River Flower Moon Night," 15 minutes, free, miss it pity. Striking different parts different pitches, ding-ding-dong-dong, time-travel feeling拉满.

## Xi'an People's Schedule

Ancient times Bell Tower rang bell every morning (morning bell evening drum), Drum Tower drummed at night, entire Chang'an city lived听钟鼓 sound—day broke time to rise, sky darkened time to go home, curfew began. Bell Tower isn't just architecture, it's this city's biological clock.

Now Bell Tower below is Xi'an's busiest crossroads, underground has tunnel (don't try surface crossing, will be散 by traffic). Daily hundreds of thousands pass through—commuting, shopping, out-of-town tourists—everyone glances up at Bell Tower, continues rushing, just like ancients听钟 sound continued rushing.

**There's a Legend**: Bell Tower foundation镇着 a dragon vein, as long as Bell Tower doesn't fall, Xi'an won't衰. Though迷信, but 1556 Guanzhong earthquake (830,000 deaths, history's worst), Bell Tower only slightly tilted, later straightened, didn't even lose many bricks—ancient craftsmen's mortise-tenon structure, truly earthquake-resistant.

## Photo Tips

Daytime shoot, from southeast corner upward angle, blue sky white clouds background, can shoot Bell Tower's towering height. Nighttime shoot, from south gate underground tunnel emerge, frontal平视, lights + traffic light trails, blockbuster即视感.

Couples like selfies at Bell Tower roundabout flower bed edge (only shoot from ground, don't climb flower bed), but crowded, need queue. I suggest go Drum Tower Square, 300m from Bell Tower, can shoot Bell Tower and Drum Tower into same frame, composition more layered.

With children, tower below square has pigeons (flew here themselves, not fed), kids can chase and play half hour. But don't buy those ¥10 pigeon food—pigeons overfed, bad for birds too.

## Foodie Map

Bell Tower surroundings food paradise. West 300m is Muslim Quarter, lamb pita, soup dumplings, sesame cold noodles, mirror cakes, persimmon cakes—one street eat till supporting wall to walk.

East has "Fan's Preserved Meat Roujiamo" (East Street Luomashi), old brand, roujiamo ¥15, meat stewed till melts in mouth, bread baked crispy outside tender inside, Xi'an people's soul breakfast.

South Daoxiangcun mall basement has "Wei Family Cold Noodles," sesame cold noodles ¥8, pair with Bingfeng soda (Xi'an specialty, orange-flavored soda, ¥3), spice-relief神器.

North has halal temple snack cluster, lamb-beef pita authentic, plus hand-grabbed lamb, lamb offal soup, grilled lamb skewers—Xi'an's halal cuisine, is Muslim Quarter外的 another重 flavor.

## Night Bell Tower Has More Magic

7 PM lights on, golden lights shine bottom-up, illuminating entire tower like glazed pagoda. Surrounding traffic endless, traffic lights, neon lights, car lights, modern and classical fuse seamlessly at this moment.

Bell Tower below has speakers playing guzheng music, "High Mountains Flowing Water" "Fishing Boat Singing at Dusk," mixed with traffic sound, magical yet harmonious. Couples date at roundabout edge, elderly dance in square, out-of-town tourists hold phones livestreaming—this is living Xi'an, not just history, also present.

## Where Next?

West to Drum Tower and Muslim Quarter (5 min walk), night market热闹. South to Shuyuan Gate (10 min walk), antique calligraphy-painting street, literary youth favorite. East to Luomashi pedestrian street (shopping paradise), north to Saojinqiao (locals' late-night snack holy land, more接地气 than Muslim Quarter).

Or just sit on Bell Tower Square stone steps, watch people come and go. Xi'an is city full of stories, and Bell Tower is these stories' table of contents—every passerby is a page.

Alright, underground tunnel entrances in all four directions, follow signs, don't get lost. Tower open 8:30-20:30 (winter closes earlier 18:00), late visitors note time. Let's go hear ancient bell sound, watch modern traffic!
