# ♨️ Huaqing Pool – Yang Guifei's Bath and Zhang Xueliang's Remonstrance

**Lintong District, Mount Li Foot**

Everyone, see this garden? 3,000 years ago King You of Zhou built Ligong here, Qin Shi Huang expanded for hot springs bathing, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang brought Yang Guifei here every winter for three-month retreats—this was emperors' exclusive resort, hot springs year-round 43°C, containing sulfur and various minerals, bathing makes skin slippery as peeled egg, no wonder Guifei "hot springs water滑 washing凝脂."

But December 12, 1936, here staged China's fate-changing "Xi'an Incident"—Chiang Kai-shek stayed at Five-Room Hall, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng staged military remonstrance, gunshots rang out, Chiang Kai-shek barefoot climbed wall escaping, hid in Mount Li mid-mountain rock crevice and was caught. History's turning points sometimes happen beside a hot spring pool.

**Now early March spring**, 12°C, Mount Li peach blossoms just opening, pink-white mixed. Sunset 6:30, suggest afternoon来, after touring Huaqing Pool climb Mount Li watching sunset, descend just in time for evening "Everlasting Regret" show (8 PM starts, tickets ¥238-988, worth watching).

## Guifei Bath: Luxury Archaeological Evidence

Enter garden head straight to Guifei Pool—begonia-flower-shaped white marble bath, 1.2m deep, pool bottom has hot spring mouth咕嘟咕嘟 bubbling hot water (now doesn't放水, but can see outlet). Bai Juyi wrote "spring cold granted bath Huaqing Pool, hot springs water滑 washing凝脂," talking about here.

**Archaeological Details**: Tang Dynasty baths used bluestone slabs, edges polished extremely smooth, Guifei bathing wouldn't get scratched. Poolside has steps (nine levels, symbolizing nine heavens), descending had dedicated palace maids supporting. Pool bottom has drain holes, after bathing water directly drains, every time fresh hot spring water—Emperor Xuanzong's spoiling of Guifei, even bath design reflects.

Nearby Lotus Soup is Emperor Xuanzong's bath, twice as big as Guifei Pool, square, symbolizing imperial power's righteousness. But Xuanzong often climbed wall去Guifei Pool串门 (archaeology found secret passage between two pools), so his pool常年 idle.

## Five-Room Hall: Bullet Holes Still on Walls

West is Five-Room Hall, where Chiang Kai-shek stayed 1936. Rooms preserve that year's layout—desk, bed, telephone, map. Walls have bullet holes. December 12, 1936 dawn, Zhang Xueliang's guards rushed in, Chiang Kai-shek heard gunshots, barefoot jumped from back window, climbed wall escaping to Mount Li, hid in mid-mountain rock crevice (now called "Military Remonstrance Pavilion"), caught while shivering from cold, dentures fell out.

**History's Irony**: Military Remonstrance Pavilion originally called "Catch Chiang Pavilion," later changed to "Military Remonstrance Pavilion" (politically correct). But local elders still call "Catch Chiang Pavilion," history's another recording method.

Bullet holes are real, I touched with finger, indented, bullet shot into wood traces. That night changed KMT-CCP relations, facilitated second KMT-CCP cooperation, also changed Anti-Japanese War direction. History's turning points sometimes hide in one bullet hole.

## Mount Li: Climb or Not?

Mount Li elevation 1,302m, but Huaqing Pool side only climb to mid-mountain (300m) enough, distance 1.5km, 30 minutes, gentle slope, elderly children can all上. Mountain top has Old Mother Hall (legend Nüwa refined stones patching sky here), but average stamina, reaching Military Remonstrance Pavilion can walk back.

**Mountain Surprises**: Mount Li is migratory bird route, spring-autumn can see raptors (kestrels, goshawks) circling mountain top. Mountain slope has wild jujube trees, autumn bearing small red fruits, sour enough to lose teeth but vitamin C explosive, roadside pick some taste (don't pick too much, leave些给birds).

Evening climb mountain watching sunset, entire Weihe Plain spreads at feet, golden sheet. Distance is Qinling Mountains, near is Terracotta Warriors Museum roof, history and nature fuse in this perspective.

## "Everlasting Regret" Show: Must-See!

Evening 8 PM, Huaqing Pool Jiulong Lake Square, large-scale real-scene historical dance drama "Everlasting Regret" opens. 300 performers, using Mount Li as backdrop, lake surface as stage, telling Emperor Xuanzong and Yang Guifei's love tragedy—from meeting to spoiling, from An-Shi Rebellion to Mawei Slope strangulation death, 70 minutes, lights, music, dance, fireworks all on, shocking enough to raise goosebumps.

**Ticket Booking Suggestions**: Mid-section tickets (¥538) best perspective, don't buy side tickets (can't see fully). Book online advance, on-site buy ¥100 more expensive. April-October nightly shows (winter停演), rainy days cancel. Bring jacket, night lakeside cold, mosquitoes numerous.

Show's most tear-inducing segment: After Yang Guifei strangled死, Xuanzong holds her corpse crying in rain, mountain-wide lights extinguish, only one追光 hits him—flourishing Tang's glory, thus curtain falls in rain. Audience full of sobbing sounds.

## How to Come/What to Eat

From Xi'an Train Station take Tour Bus 5 (30km, 1 hour, ¥7), or Metro Line 9 to Huaqing Pool Station (exit walk 10 minutes). Ticket ¥120 (students half price), includes Huaqing Pool + Mount Li. "Everlasting Regret" ticket separate purchase.

Garden has restaurants, but expensive and mediocre. Exit turn left 500m, Lintong County town pile of small eateries, recommend "Lao Tongguan Roujiamo" (¥15, different from Xi'an version, is shaobing夹肉, crispy outside soft inside), "Shaanxi Cold Noodles" (¥8, summer must-order).

Specialties: Lintong pomegranates (September-November in season, thin skin juicy, ¥5 per jin), don't buy at scenic area entrance (rip-off), walk to county town market, half price.

## Can Still Bathe in Hot Springs?

Can! Huaqing Pool Yutang Hotel has hot spring hotel, rooms with private hot spring pools (from ¥1,680/night), or buy hot spring ticket (¥168/3 hours), bathe in same 43°C sulfur spring as Guifei. Water is real, pumped directly from underground, after bathing skin slippery, sulfur smell can smell one day.

Don't expect that pool Guifei bathed in (cultural relic, doesn't放水), but water source is same, Tang Dynasty hot spring eye still flows now.

## Where Next?

East 5km is Terracotta Warriors Museum, two attractions can play one day (first Warriors, then Huaqing Pool, evening watch "Everlasting Regret"). West 30km back Xi'an city, Bell-Drum Towers Muslim Quarter eat what should eat browse what should browse.

My personal suggestion? After watching "Everlasting Regret," sit by Jiulong Lake. Performers scattered, tourists gone, lake surface returns to calm, moon reflected in water. Mount Li's silhouette in night like sleeping giant, 3,000 years stories all sink into earth, only hot springs still bubbling, 咕嘟咕嘟, like history's breathing.

Alright, entrance security, large bags check (free). "Everlasting Regret" seating first-come-first-served, 30 minutes advance entry占位. Let's go meet that emperor who gave up江山 for beauty, and that young marshal who staged military remonstrance changing history!
