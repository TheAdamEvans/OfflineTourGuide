Huaqing Pool: Hot Springs, Imperial Romance, and a Kidnapping That Changed China

This place has two stories, separated by 1,200 years. First story: Tang Dynasty emperor Xuanzong brings his beloved concubine Yang Guifei here every winter to bathe in the hot springs. They're so obsessed with each other that he neglects the government, triggering a rebellion that nearly destroys the dynasty. Second story: 1936, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is staying here when his own generals stage a military coup, kidnap him, and force him to stop fighting Communists and start fighting the Japanese. Both stories ended badly for the protagonists. Both shaped Chinese history.

We're in Lintong District at the foot of Mount Li, 30km east of Xi'an. It's early March, about 12°C, with peach blossoms starting to open on the mountain slopes. Sunset's at 6:30pm. The "Song of Everlasting Sorrow" performance starts at 8pm (April-October only, ¥238-988 depending on seats). If you're seeing the show, arrive by 5pm to tour the pools first.

The hot springs here have been famous for 3,000 years. King You of Zhou built the first bathing complex in 800 BCE. Qin Shihuang expanded it. Every dynasty since has rebuilt, enlarged, and improved it. The water comes from underground at a constant 43°C, rich in sulfur and minerals. The Tang emperors came here annually—sometimes for months—because the springs supposedly prolonged life and beautified skin.

Yang Guifei's bath—Guifei Pool—is shaped like a lotus flower, carved from white marble. It's 1.2 meters deep with nine stone steps descending into the water (symbolizing the nine heavens). The edges are polished glass-smooth so her skin wouldn't scratch. After bathing, the water drained completely, refilled fresh from the hot spring for each use. Emperor Xuanzong's bath is twice the size, square, symbolizing masculine authority. But archaeologists found a secret passage connecting the two pools, suggesting he climbed over to visit her more often than he used his own.

The pools don't hold water now (they're cultural relics), but you can see the spring outlets, still bubbling hot water after 3,000 years. Stand close and you'll feel the heat rising.

Five Rooms Hall is where the other story happened. December 12, 1936, Chiang Kai-shek was staying here, coordinating his campaign against Communist forces. His own generals—Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng—decided this was insane while Japan invaded from the north. At 5am, Zhang's troops stormed the compound. Gunfire erupted. Chiang, barefoot and in his nightclothes, jumped out a back window, scaled the garden wall, and ran up Mount Li. He hid in a rock crevice halfway up the mountain for hours before being captured, shivering and missing his dentures.

The rooms are preserved as they were: desk, maps, telephone, bed. The walls still have bullet holes—real ones, you can touch them. The indentations are small, precise, evidence of a moment when history pivoted. That kidnapping (the Xi'an Incident) forced the second United Front between Nationalists and Communists, changing the course of the war and, arguably, modern Chinese history.

Mount Li rises behind the complex. You can hike to the spot where Chiang hid—Military Remonstrance Pavilion, about 300 meters elevation, 30-minute moderate climb. The trail is paved but steep. The view from halfway up is worth it: the entire Wei River Plain spread below, golden in late afternoon light, with the Terracotta Warriors Museum roof visible to the east.

The evening performance, "Song of Everlasting Sorrow," uses the mountain as a backdrop and the lake as a stage. 300 performers, lasers, music, fireworks, dance—it's 70 minutes of spectacle telling the Xuanzong-Yang Guifei love tragedy. When Yang Guifei is executed at Mawei Slope (historical fact: the army forced Xuanzong to kill her to quell the rebellion), the whole mountain goes dark except one spotlight on the actor holding her body. The audience goes silent. It's genuinely moving, even if you don't speak Chinese.

Tickets: book online in advance, mid-section seats (¥538) have the best view. The show runs April-October only (too cold in winter). It occasionally cancels for rain, so check weather. Bring a jacket—lakeside at night gets cold and mosquitoes are vicious.

Entry to Huaqing Pool itself is ¥120 (student discount available), includes the pools, Five Rooms Hall, and Mount Li access. The "Song of Everlasting Sorrow" is separate. You can also stay overnight—Huaqing Pool has a hot spring hotel with private hot spring baths in rooms (from ¥1,680/night) or day-use hot spring tickets (¥168/3 hours). The water is real, pumped from the same source Yang Guifei used. After bathing, your skin feels unnaturally smooth and smells faintly of sulfur for hours.

Getting here: Tour Bus 5 from Xi'an Train Station (¥7, 1 hour), or Metro Line 9 to Huaqing Pool Station (10-minute walk from the exit). Combine this with the Terracotta Warriors (5km east)—see the warriors in the morning, Huaqing Pool in the afternoon, stay for the evening show. You'll be back in Xi'an by 10pm if you skip the show, midnight if you stay.

Food: skip the park restaurants (overpriced, mediocre). Exit and walk 500 meters into Lintong town. "Lao Tongguan Roujiamo" (¥15) is a local variant—meat stuffed into a sesame flatbread that's baked until crispy, different from Xi'an's version but excellent. Or try Shaanxi-style cold noodles (¥8, perfect on hot days). Lintong pomegranates are famous (September-November), sold by farmers at the market for ¥5/jin—thin skin, sweet, juicy. Don't buy at the park entrance; walk into town for honest prices.

What strikes me every time: this place is layered. Hot springs that kings bathed in 3,000 years ago still flow. A love affair from 1,200 years ago still defines Chinese romantic tragedy. A kidnapping from 1936 still shapes geopolitics. And tourists like us walk through, taking photos, eating snacks, occasionally pausing to think about how love, power, and history entangle in ways we can't predict.

Yang Guifei died at 37. Chiang Kai-shek lived to 87 but spent his last decades exiled in Taiwan, forbidden to return to the mainland. The hot springs outlasted them both. Water doesn't care about empire, romance, or revolution. It just keeps flowing, 43°C, mineral-rich, indifferent.
