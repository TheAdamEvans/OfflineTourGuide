# 🏛️ Underground Army – A Secret Silent for Two Thousand Years

**Lintong District, Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum**

Welcome everyone! You know what? This army of 8,000 has been silent underground for 2,200 years until 1974 when three farmers digging a well swung their hoe and shocked the world. Now follow me—I'll take you to meet these soldiers who never retired.

Beneath our feet is ancient Qin land. The Qin people's ancient language is lost, but they unified writing, currency, weights and measures—today you can read road signs anywhere in China thanks to that ambitious young emperor in 221 BCE.

**Now it's November morning**, 8°C, the sun hasn't completely dispersed the thin mist at Mount Li's foot. Afternoon will rise to around 16°C, but these pits stay year-round at 13-15°C, cool and damp. Suggest wearing a light jacket—don't be silly like me the first time, wearing short sleeves and shivering.

## The震撼 of Pit 1

Enter Pit 1, don't rush to photograph. Stop, breathe deep—smell that earth mixed with millennia? Look at this 230-meter array before you, over 6,000 terracotta figures, each face different. Really, different. Guanzhong craftsmen molded them after real soldiers' faces—hook-nosed, square-faced, dimpled, frowning—this is an army with flesh and blood, just the blood has long turned to earth.

**What震撼s me most?** Their hands. Look carefully, each soldier's hands maintain the gesture of gripping weapons—spears, halberds, bows, swords—but weapons were plundered by Xiang Yu's army two thousand years ago. The soldiers still stand guard, even with empty hands. This loyalty breaks your heart.

Those kneeling archer figures' shoe soles still show clear stitching from two thousand years ago. Craftsmen made even shoe soles so carefully because they believed the emperor would cross between yin and yang to inspect.

## How to Get Here (Don't Take Wrong路)

From Xi'an city take Tour Bus 5 (departs from east square of train station), 1 hour direct, ¥7—don't take those shouting "Terracotta Warriors special line" black cars. Or take Metro Line 9 to Huaqing Pool Station and transfer to bus, 20 minutes longer but you can see wheat fields on the Wei River plain.

**Old guide's suggestion**: Enter at 8:30 AM opening, tour groups generally don't arrive till after 9:30. After 4 PM there are also fewer people, but light isn't as good as morning. Weekends and holidays? Avoid if possible—Pit 1 can get packed as tight as the terracotta warriors themselves.

With children, audio guide is a must (Chinese/English/children's version, ¥20). Pit 3 has interactive screens让小朋友 "restore" terracotta figures—they'll be fascinated. Strollers can go in, but don't get too close to pit edges—not afraid of you, afraid of scaring cultural relic guards.

## Details Not to Miss

Pit 3 is smallest but most important—this is command headquarters. 68 officer figures stand in "凹" shape, like holding a战 meeting. Walls have traces of ancient fire—Xiang Yu's fire burned not just wood, but the Qin Empire's grand dream.

Pit 2 has kneeling archers, standing archers, cavalry figures, and one best-preserved bronze chariot (replica here, real one in cultural relic exhibition hall—don't miss the treasure). That bronze chariot has over 1,700 parts, umbrella canopy can rotate, windows can open and close—2,200 years ago technology level was frighteningly advanced.

Mount Li's Qin Shi Huang tomb mound hasn't been excavated—not unwilling, but afraid. "Records of the Grand Historian" says the tomb has rivers and seas made of mercury, modern detection confirms palace mercury content seriously exceeds standards. The emperor's secrets still lie beneath that dou-shaped earthen hill.

## Eat Something Authentic

Museums restaurants outside—dodge if you can. Take bus back to Lintong County town (10 minutes), find "Liu San Stone Bread" on old street—this bread is baked with pebbles, crispy outside soft inside, one bite full of Sichuan pepper leaf fragrance, ¥3 each. Pair with oil-splashed noodles (Shaanxi soul, when chili oil hits with that "tss" sound, fragrance travels three streets), ¥20 fills you up.

Buy some Lintong pomegranates (November is peak season)—thin skin juicy, seeds soft enough to chew directly, ten times better than thick-skinned hard-seeded supermarket varieties. Old farmers sell them, ¥5 per jin, don't mind the rustic look.

## Where Next?

5 kilometers east is Huaqing Pool, where Yang Guifei bathed in hot springs, Mount Li autumn colors just right. North back to Xi'an, Bell and Drum Towers, Muslim Quarter lively at night, lamb pita bread soup—tearing bread till hands hurt but worth it.

Or just sit on stone steps outside the museum and rest, look at Mount Li—that mountain guards Qin Shi Huang's tomb, guards China's history's first great unification dream, and guards the eternal silence of 8,000 soldiers.

Alright, security check twice, open bags, water allowed. After entering, don't just photograph—stop, look into their eyes, there are stories inside. Let's go!
