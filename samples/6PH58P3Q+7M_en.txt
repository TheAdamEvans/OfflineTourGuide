Okay, so Marina Bay Sands looks like three towers holding up a massive surfboard. That's intentional. Moshe Safdie designed this S$8 billion beast, opened in 2010, and it's become Singapore's entire brand.

The SkyPark on top is 1.2 hectares—three football pitches—perched 57 storeys up. The infinity pool is 150 meters long and feels like you're swimming off the edge of the world. But here's the catch: pool's only for hotel guests, and rooms start at S$400 a night. Don't let Instagram fool you.

You can still go up to the observation deck for S$32. Book online, save S$3. Best time? Just before sunset, around 6:30pm. The city lights up, the port glitters, and the heat finally breaks. Singapore's humid year-round—30°C minimum—so you'll be sweating regardless. Bring water.

The view's incredible: Gardens by the Bay right below with those Supertree things, the Marina Bay waterfront, shipping lanes stretching to Malaysia. On clear days, you can see Indonesia. The deck gets crowded by 7pm when the light show starts, so arrive early.

Food situation's interesting. The high-end restaurants inside—CUT by Wolfgang Puck, Waku Ghin—will cost you S$300+ per person. Skip them. Walk 8 minutes to Lau Pa Sat hawker centre and get chicken rice for S$5, satay for S$8. Proper Singaporean food, not tourist prices.

Getting here's easy. Bayfront MRT station opens directly into the mall. Take the Circle or Downtown line. The entire Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands mall is underneath—luxury brands, air-conditioning, the works. There's a canal running through it with gondola rides if you want to feel like you're in Vegas trying to be Venice.

The ArtScience Museum's next door—looks like a lotus flower, sometimes has decent exhibitions. S$19 entry. Or walk 10 minutes across the Helix Bridge (stunning at night with LED lights) to get to the Esplanade if there's a performance on.

Light show at the waterfront is every night, 8pm and 9pm, free. Spectra show with water jets and lasers. Touristy but kind of fun. Best viewing spot is the Event Plaza near the Louis Vuitton Island Maison.

Pro tip: the building looks better from outside than inside. Take your photos from across the bay at Merlion Park, then come over for the view up top. Bus 133 connects everything around Marina Bay if you're tired of walking in the heat.
