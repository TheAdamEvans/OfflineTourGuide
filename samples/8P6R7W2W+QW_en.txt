Bike the Wall: Pedaling Through 600 Years of Ming Dynasty History

The first time I biked the entire circuit—13.74 kilometers—I had to stop three times. Not because I was tired (though I was), but because the view kept changing: ancient gray tiles inside the wall, modern skyscrapers outside, and me pedaling along the top of a 600-year-old fortification. It's surreal.

We're at Yongning Gate (South Gate) in Beilin District, mid-October, about 20°C with autumn sun that makes the old bricks glow amber. Sunset's at 5:50pm—perfect if you start around 4pm. You'll finish the loop just as the city lights come on and the wall glows gold. Pack a light jacket; it gets windy up here.

This wall sits on Sui-Tang dynasty foundations, but what you're standing on is pure Ming Dynasty—built during the reign of Emperor Hongwu (1374 CE) when Xi'an shrank from the vast Tang capital to a more defensive footprint. The entire circuit took 8 years to build, employed tens of thousands of workers, and required kilns working overtime to fire millions of bricks.

The wall is 12-14 meters wide at the top—wide enough to run four horse-drawn chariots side by side. In Ming times, soldiers patrolled up here, watching for threats from the north. Every 120 meters, you'll see "horse faces" (protruding platforms for archers) sticking out from the wall. There are 98 of them total, creating overlapping fields of fire. No blind spots. Whoever designed this knew warfare.

Bike rental is at the gates: ¥45 for a single bike (100 minutes), ¥90 for a tandem (100 minutes). I always recommend tandems for couples—not because they're romantic (they are), but because pedaling in sync while one person navigates turns out to be hilarious and humbling. You'll either laugh or divorce.

Pro tip: Don't start at South Gate if you can help it. It's the most famous entrance, which means crowds and bike queues. Go to Hanguang Gate (southwest corner) instead—fewer people, same bikes, and there's a small museum showing cross-sections of the wall's construction. You can literally see 1,400 years of history layered like geological strata.

The ride itself is easy—flat, paved, with occasional ramps where gates break the circuit. You'll pass watchtowers every few hundred meters, most of them restored. Some have small exhibits inside (free), showing old photos of the wall in the 1920s when parts of it had crumbled and locals used the bricks for houses. The fact that so much survived is remarkable.

Look inward as you ride: you'll see the old city, a maze of gray-tiled courtyard homes, narrow alleys (hutongs), and pockets of green where locals grow vegetables. It's living history—people actually reside inside these walls. Look outward: the moat (now a park with willow trees and lotus ponds in summer), then the modern city beyond. The contrast is stark.

Stop at the southeast corner. There's a small platform where you can park your bike and just... breathe. On clear days, you can see the Qinling Mountains to the south—the natural barrier that protected Chang'an for millennia. In Tang poetry, those mountains represented both safety and separation, keeping enemies out but also keeping people in.

Around the halfway point, you'll start seeing other cyclists who've had the same idea. Everyone's grinning. There's something about being up here—suspended between past and present, pedaling along a structure older than most European cathedrals—that makes strangers nod at each other like old friends.

The wall has snack stations at all four cardinal gates: water, drinks, baozi (steamed buns), and overpriced ice cream. Prices are about 20% higher than street level, but halfway through 13.74 kilometers, you won't care. The Bingfeng soda (Xi'an's answer to Orange Crush, ¥5) is perfect.

After you descend, hit up Fan's Roujiamo just outside South Gate—5-minute walk toward Shuyuan Gate. It's a preserved meat shop that's been here since the Qing Dynasty. Their roujiamo (Chinese hamburger, ¥15) is the real deal: slow-braised pork stuffed into a crispy flatbread, juices running down your fingers. Pair it with cold noodles (liangpi, ¥8) and you've nailed Xi'an street food.

Or walk into Defu Alley (500 meters inside South Gate), a Qing Dynasty pedestrian street now full of teahouses, bars, and Shaanxi restaurants. "Lao Wan" makes the famous biang biang noodles—the character is so complex (56 strokes) it's not in Unicode. The noodles are wide as belts, hand-pulled, topped with chili oil that sizzles when it hits. It's glorious.

If you stay into evening (and you should), the wall lights up around 7:30pm in summer, 6:30pm in winter. Yellow floodlights trace the entire perimeter, turning the wall into a golden necklace around the city. The moat reflects it back, doubling the effect. Couples walk hand-in-hand below, elderly folks sit on benches chatting, and the Qinqiang opera music drifts from somewhere nearby—high-pitched, mournful, distinctly Shaanxi.

From here, you're close to everything: Beilin Museum (Forest of Steles, 800 meters inside South Gate—2,000+ stone tablets with ancient calligraphy), Muslim Quarter (inside North Gate—lamb soup and night markets), or Shuyuanmen (antique street, perfect for browsing).

But honestly? After biking the wall, I usually just sit by the moat and decompress. There's a bench on the west side where willow branches hang low and egrets fish in the shallows. You can hear the city humming beyond the wall, but up close, it's quiet. The wall has stood here through thirteen dynasties, countless wars, earthquakes, floods, and political upheavals. It's seen Xi'an rise as Chang'an, fall into obscurity, and rise again. And somehow, through all that, the wall remains—solid, immovable, patient.

Bike rental requires a ¥200 deposit or an ID card. Helmets are free (use them). The route is one-way (clockwise only), clearly marked. If you see someone taking photos, slow down—don't be the person who photobombs a wedding shoot. And please, don't ring your bell at slow riders. We're all time travelers up here. No one's in a rush.
