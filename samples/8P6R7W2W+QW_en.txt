# 🚴 City Wall – Time Machine Circling the Ancient City

**Beilin District, Yongning Gate (South Gate)**

Welcome! This wall before you—beneath is Sui-Tang imperial city foundation, the wall body is rammed earth from Ming Dynasty Hongwu reign, city bricks were fired 600 years ago. The city wall itself is a chronicle, every brick and tile tells a story.

We're in Chang'an—yes, that Chang'an from poems "Chang'an moonlight over the whole city, ten thousand households pounding clothes." This is capital of thirteen dynasties from Zhou-Qin-Han-Tang, the ground beneath our feet witnessed Chinese civilization's most glorious moments. Chang'an people's ancient elegant speech has vanished, but the city wall remembers those voices.

**Now October afternoon**, clear autumn sky, 23°C, most suitable for biking. Sunset 5:50, suggest going up city wall at 4, finishing one circuit just in time to watch sunset dye the city bricks golden. Wind not strong, but wall is open—wear light jacket just in case.

## The 13.74 Kilometer Decision

Yes, city wall circuit is 13.74 kilometers. Walking? 3-4 hours, leg workout. Biking? 1.5-2 hours, perfect. Sightseeing cart? 40 minutes, boring. I strongly suggest biking—tandem bicycles (¥90/100 minutes) most popular with couples, single bikes (¥45/100 minutes) more flexible, child seats free.

**Only老西安 know the trick**: Yongning Gate (South Gate) has most tourists, bikes need queuing. Smart people go up from Hanguang Gate or Shangde Gate (southwest section), fewer people more bikes, and Hanguang Gate has Tang Dynasty city wall cross-section museum, can see wall's geological section—1,400 years of history, layered and compressed, like cake.

Can't use e-bikes, skateboards on wall, so don't think about shortcuts. But can bring pets (leashed). I've seen people push strollers the whole circuit—salute.

## City Wall Isn't Just City Wall

Bike to southeast corner and stop, look at that protruding "horse face" (enemy platform)—one every 120 meters, 98 total, shooting blind spots fully covered. Wall top width 12-14 meters, can run four horse carriages side by side, this is真正的 "resist enemy outside国门" military design.

Moat now raises koi and grass carp, spring willows bud, summer lotus bloom fully, autumn reeds sway, winter freezes and people secretly ice skate (dangerous, don't learn). Riverside常有 egrets and night herons, at dusk watching them return to nest, strings flying past gate towers, spectacular scene.

Inside city wall is old city district, gray tiles, courtyard houses, narrow alleys, full of life's smoke and fire气. Outside is moat park, elderly morning exercise doing taiji, bird-walking grandfathers carrying birdcages, Xi'an's daily life unfolds slowly on both sides of city wall.

## South Gate's Sense of Ceremony

Yongning Gate is Xi'an's main gate, also strongest sense of ceremony. Daily 10 AM, 2 PM has仿古 gate opening ceremony (free viewing)—war drums thunder, city gate drawbridge lowers, warriors line up, shout "open city gate," very穿越 feeling.

Gate tunnel has urn城—enemy attacks through first gate, thinks succeeded, result trapped in urn城 shot from three sides, "catching turtle in jar" is how it came. Ming Dynasty military wisdom, cruel and efficient.

Gate tower has "天下第一城" plaque, Qing Dynasty Shaanxi Governor Bi Yuan inscribed. Standing on gate tower looking down, moat, drawbridge, arrow tower, urn城, gate tower, five-tier defense system clear at a glance—this is cold weapon era's ultimate fortress.

## Tired from Biking? Eat

Wall has supply points (all four cardinal gates), selling water, snacks, Shaanxi specialties (cold noodles, roujiamo, Bingfeng soda), prices 20% higher than outside, but halfway through really need it.

After descending wall, outside south gate Shuyuan Gate (5 min walk) has "Fan's Preserved Meat Roujiamo," old brand, meat stewed till falling apart, bread baked crispy, one bite juice flows down fingers, ¥15 worth it. Pair with rice noodles (cold noodles upgrade, made from rice slurry, smoother), another Bingfeng bottle, Xi'an people's standard three-piece set.

Want proper meal? Go Defu Alley (500m inside south gate), Qing Dynasty style alley, bars, teahouses, Shaanxi restaurants clustered. Recommend "Lao Wan," biangbiang noodles (that character can't be typed, 56 strokes) wide as belt, oil-splashed chili poured on, fragrant enough to make next table people cry from craving.

## Night City Wall More Magic

If you stay till evening, city wall lights up (summer 7:30, winter 6:30), yellow lights outline entire city wall contour, like a golden dragon coiled around city heart. Moat reflection sways, occasionally cruise boat passes, boat传来 Qinqiang opera—high-pitched, desolate, strikes the soul.

South gate night view best, drawbridge, gate tower, lights, reflection, four-in-one, casual snap都是 masterpiece. Couples stroll beneath city wall, elderly couples sit on riverside benches chatting, this city's tenderness hides in these ordinary moments.

## After Descending Wall, Where to Go?

Beilin Museum (800m inside south gate) collects over 2,000 steles, Yan Zhenqing, Liu Gongquan, Ouyang Xun's authentic works都在, calligraphy enthusiasts' paradise. Or go Muslim Quarter (inside north gate), lamb pita bread soup, zeng gao, persimmon cakes eat till supporting wall to walk.

My favorite? After biking find a teahouse by moat, order pot of fucha (Shaanxi specialty, fermented tea, warms stomach), sit till dark. Watching city wall change from daytime's majesty to nighttime's gentleness, suddenly understand why this city could live thirteen dynasties—it's hard enough, also soft enough.

Alright, bike rental at south gate urn城 inside, deposit ¥200 or ID card, helmet free. Remember clockwise biking (required direction), when encountering photographing tourists slow down, don't ring bell to rush people—on city wall, everyone is time traveler, not急 this moment. Let's go, 13.74 kilometer穿越 journey, begin!
