# 🏮 Tang Paradise – A Meticulously Choreographed Flourishing Tang Dream

**Yanta District, Qujiang New District**

Everyone, first the truth: this isn't a cultural relic, it's a Tang Dynasty imperial garden replica built in 2005. But! Built on Tang Dynasty Furong Garden ruins, 1:1 restoration per historical records, ¥1.3 billion invested, 1,000 acres—this is a gamble to revive flourishing Tang aesthetics with modern technology, worth seeing.

Beneath our feet 1,300 years ago was Qujiang Pool, Tang Dynasty imperial forbidden garden. Li Bai, Du Fu, Bai Juyi all drank and wrote poems here. "Qujiang spring colors fill garden flowers"—that era's luxury has turned to silt at water bottom, we can only imagine that prosperous twilight through this new garden.

**Now April evening**, 18°C, peonies blooming (30,000 plants in garden), air drifts with flower fragrance mixed with lake water's fishy smell. Sunset 7 PM, night scene lights 8 PM, water screen movie 8:30—if seeing only one show, see night scene.

## This Is a "Murder Mystery" Garden

Don't treat this like a park—it's a three-dimensional Tang history book. Ziyun Tower (tallest central building) is garden's high point, climb for layout view—nine zones corresponding to nine Tang culture aspects: poetry, tea, ladies, imperial exams, song-dance... Each zone has immersive performances.

**My Recommended Route**: North gate enter → Ziyun Tower see panorama → Phoenix Theater watch "Dream Back to Tang" song-dance (3 PM, 8 PM shows, ¥238 separate ticket but worth it) → Ladies Hall photos (Tang costume rental ¥80/hour, makeup extra) → lakeside stroll, wait for nightfall.

Lu Yu Tea House can drink Tang Dynasty tea-boiling method restored fucha, tea kettle boils, add salt for seasoning, one sip feels like time travel. Xing Garden is imperial exam culture zone, walls carved with Tang Dynasty jinshi name lists—find your fellow townsfolk?

## Details Not to Miss

Imperial Gate stone lions glare huge—that's Tang style. Lions came from Western Regions, craftsmen hadn't seen real ones, could only carve from imagination, so Tang lions especially cute, completely different style from Song-Ming威严 lions.

Fanglin Garden's peonies "Yao Yellow" "Wei Purple" are descendants of Tang Dynasty famous varieties, flowers big as bowl mouths, "国色天香" isn't empty. April-May, whole garden full of flower fanatics, carrying telephoto lenses shooting till dark.

Colored Clouds Gallery has long scroll murals painting "Night Banquet of Han Xizai" (though Five Dynasties work, shows late Tang customs), carefully看那些 ladies' hair buns, clothing, eyes—Tang people's plump aesthetics, how long could it persist before Song Dynasty's slender small faces?

## Nighttime Is Main Show

8 PM lights on, entire garden comes alive. Ziyun Tower bathed in golden lights, reflected in lake, shimmering波光. Gallery red lanterns light up in strings, guzheng sound floats from teahouse, you'll instantly understand what "Chang'an moonlight over whole city, ten thousand households pounding clothes" means.

8:30 PM water screen movie must-see—60m-wide water screen, laser projection, tells Emperor Xuanzong and Yang Guifei story, soundtrack is "Drunken Concubine" excerpts, 20 minutes performs "Everlasting Regret." Standing opposite shore watching, free, but arrive 40 minutes early for position (west shore best).

Night ticket (after 6 PM entry) ¥20 cheaper, but many halls close 5 PM, weigh options. I suggest 4 PM入园, see halls and performances, then stay till evening for lights, kill two birds.

## Serious Advice About Food

Garden dining expensive and mediocre, one bowl Shaanxi noodles ¥38 (outside ¥8), unless急着充饥, endure. Bring bread snacks allowed (security doesn't check food), lakeside bench picnic quite pleasant.

After exiting, south gate Furong New World food street (3 min walk) full of restaurants. Recommend "Chang'an Tavern," environment antique, brush menu, gourd chicken, warm-mixed kidney strips, lamb stew all authentic, ¥100 per person average.

Or walk north 10 minutes to Giant Wild Goose Pagoda North Square, underground mall has "Xi'an Restaurant" "Defachang Dumpling Hall," old brands, expensive but no踩雷. Evening Muslim Quarter also open, lamb pita late-night snack let's go.

## Truth Time

Some say "fake antique, boring." I partially agree. This确实 isn't真文物, but it's a sincere tribute to flourishing Tang aesthetics. Architects researched 20 years Tang architecture history, woodwork, painting, proportions all讲究, hundred times better than Hengdian Studios' crude仿古.

If you're artifact控, might disappoint. But if bringing children, want them to体感 "what was Tang Dynasty like," this is Xi'an's best choice. History books are skeleton, Furong Garden is flesh, combine both to understand why flourishing Tang is Chinese people's collective nostalgia.

## Where Next?

Directly north 1km is Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, directly south 2km is Qujiang Ocean Park (child神器). I personally recommend walking along Qujiang Pool Ruins Park—free open, weeping willows, reeds, water birds, sunset, no commercial气, only Xi'an locals strolling, that's living Chang'an.

Alright, ticket ¥120 (student/elderly half price), buy online save ¥10. Bring ID, strict security. After entering don't rush photos, first go Ziyun Tower get free map, plan route, otherwise 1,000 acres wander till legs break and lose things.

Let's go see flourishing Tang! Even if it's a replica, better than永远错过.
