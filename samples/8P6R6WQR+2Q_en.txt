# 🥁 Drum Tower – Ancient City's Evening Drum and Muslim Quarter's Guardian

**Beilin District, Jianfu Temple Street**

Everyone, look! Bell Tower's twin brother arrives. Drum Tower is four years older (1380), also slightly taller (34m vs 36m, but Drum Tower stands on high platform, visually more magnificent). Ancients said "morning bell evening drum"—Bell Tower wakes whole city at dawn, Drum Tower handles evening curfew—a city's on/off switch held by these two towers.

Beneath our feet is Jianfu Temple ruins. Tang Dynasty this was temple, Ming Dynasty building Drum Tower tore temple down. Chang'an city layered and compressed, Tang pressing Han, Ming pressing Tang, history like thousand-layer pastry, hiding secrets layer by layer.

**Now June evening**, 28°C, sun starting to slant west, heat hasn't散. Sunset 8 PM, tower top cooler than ground (high place windy), but mosquitoes numerous, wear long pants. Night scene 8:30 lights on, Drum Tower + Bell Tower illuminate together, best time for photos.

## China's Largest Drum, No Longer Beaten

Climb tower (ticket ¥35, Bell+Drum combo ¥50 better deal), up to second floor, you'll see giant drum—diameter 2.83m, height 3.43m, whole cowhide cover. This is 1996 replica, original drum cracked in Ming Dynasty (too big, couldn't handle thermal expansion-contraction), broken drumskin still displayed in museum.

**How loud were Drum Tower drums?** Historical records say "drum sound audible 30 li away." Evening xu time (7-9 PM), Drum Tower beat time-drums, whole city heard, every household closed doors, street night-watch更夫 began duty. Now Drum Tower has daily drum performance (9:00/10:00/11:00/14:30/15:30/16:30, holidays add shows), performers wear Ming costumes, forcefully beat drums, boom-boom-boom, shaking floor, 20 minutes, blood-pumping.

Tower also has 24 small drums representing 24 solar terms—Start of Spring, Rain Water, Awakening of Insects... Each term one drum, drumskins painted with corresponding agricultural activities. Ancients used drum sound to remind: time to plant, time to harvest, time to prepare for winter. Drum Tower is clock, also calendar.

## Standing on Drum Tower Seeing Two Xi'ans

Drum Tower north is Muslim Quarter, mosques, archways, snack stalls, Hui elders wearing white caps, rich Islamic flavor. South is Bell Tower, Han district, academies, teahouses, antique shops, Confucian culture circle. Drum Tower like an invisible boundary, separating two cultures, but cleverly connecting them.

Climbing tower looking north, Muslim Quarter's blue-gray rooftops连绵, cooking smoke curling (actually lamb pita steam), air drifts with cumin and Sichuan pepper fragrance. Looking south, Bell Tower resplendent, modern skyscrapers林立, traffic如织. One tower, two worlds.

**Historical Gossip**: Drum Tower base is brick-stone structure, hollow inside, has secret passages to underground (now sealed, not open). Republican era bandits dug, wanted treasure, only found Ming Dynasty pottery shards. But this proves one thing—Drum Tower underground might still bury things.

## Architectural Detail Aesthetics

Drum Tower is double-eave hip roof, one more eave than Bell Tower, looks more stable. Roof ridge beasts (dragon, phoenix, lion, heavenly horse) total 9, arranged by rank, this is imperial specification. Eave corners slightly翘, like spreading bird wings, called "飞檐," beautiful and practical (rainwater flings out along eave corners, doesn't drip on walls).

Wood carvings painted decorations also worth close viewing—beams carved with bats (fortune), deer (prosperity), cranes (longevity), dougong crevices hiding small wood人, small wood horses, these are craftsmen's signatures, proving "I did this work."

Tower interior has Ming-Qing furniture exhibition, rosewood tables-chairs, redwood screens, ivory-inlaid jewelry boxes, all大户人家's dowry. Look at those carvings, densely packed, fine as hair—ancient craftsmen had no power tools, all hand-carved, how much patience needed?

## Muslim Quarter Right Below Tower

Descend Drum Tower, Beiyuanmen Muslim Quarter right before eyes. First time? Don't rush in, listen to me first:

**Minefield Guide**: Muslim Quarter is tourist street, expensive prices, crowded, many shops not authentic. Want real Xi'an taste, go Saojinqiao (500m west of Muslim Quarter, locals go) or Dapianyuan (Muslim Quarter east, relatively quiet).

**But Muslim Quarter Also Has Treasure Shops**: "Lao Sun's Lamb Pita" (Beiyuanmen 93), "Jia San Soup Dumplings" (Beiyuanmen 131), "Honghong Sauerkraut Fried Rice" (West Yangshi) all老字号, taste online.

**Late-Night Snack Recommendations**: After 10 PM, Muslim Quarter tourists散, locals emerge. "Ma Er Li BBQ's" lamb skewers grilled fresh, ¥10 for 3 skewers, crispy outside tender inside. "Ding Family Small Crispy Meat's" crispy meat pita, meat fried crispy, soaked in soup absorbing juice, one bite满嘴幸福.

## Drum Tower's Evening Belongs to Music

8:30 PM, Drum Tower lights up, golden lights echoing Bell Tower, middle is Beiyuanmen pedestrian street, crowds如织. Summer square has street artist performances—playing guzheng, singing Qinqiang opera, blowing xun (ancient clay instrument, sound desolate enough to make you cry).

Every lunar August 15 (Mid-Autumn Festival), Drum Tower has large performance,仿古 moon worship ceremony + drum performance + folk music ensemble, free viewing, but sea of people, need 2 hours advance position-grabbing.

One Mid-Autumn I heard xun solo here, piece called "Chu Song," desolate, tragic, like coming from 2,000-year-old battlefield. Performance finished, square quiet for three seconds, then thunderous applause—this is ancient music's charm, transcending language, striking soul directly.

## Where Next?

North to Muslim Quarter late-night snacks, south to Bell Tower Square night photos, west to Saojinqiao finding local food, east to Shuyuanmen browsing antiques-calligraphy.

My personal favorite route? After Drum Tower, go Dapianyuan (300m northeast of Drum Tower) find halal teahouse, order pot eight-treasure tea (red dates, goji, longan, rock sugar, green tea, sweet, ¥8), sit in courtyard, listen elders chat (don't understand Shaanxi dialect doesn't matter, listen to intonation), watch sunset dye Drum Tower golden.

That moment you'll understand, Xi'an isn't just Terracotta Warriors and Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, more importantly these smoke-and-fire daily routines—brewing tea, chatting, beating drums, hawking, sunset, cooking smoke. History is skeleton, daily life is flesh.

Alright, tower open 8:30-20:30 (winter closes 18:00), combo ticket suggest Drum Tower first (fewer people), then Bell Tower. Let's go hear ancient drum sound, taste Muslim Quarter's smoke-and-fire!
