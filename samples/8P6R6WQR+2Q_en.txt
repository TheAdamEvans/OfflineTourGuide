The Drum Tower: Evening Drumbeats and the Gateway to Halal Xi'an

Morning bell, evening drum—that's how Chang'an kept time for a thousand years. The Bell Tower woke the city at dawn. The Drum Tower, 300 meters west, sent everyone home at dusk. Now it's mostly a landmark, but twice a day, performers beat the massive drums in a choreographed show that rattles your sternum and reminds you this tower once controlled the rhythm of daily life.

We're at Jianfu Temple Street in Beilin District, late June, about 28°C with heat that doesn't quit until after 8pm. Sunset's at 8pm, and the tower lights up around 8:30pm. Come in late afternoon (4-5pm) to climb before the crowds, then stick around for the evening illumination. Bring water—it's hot.

The Drum Tower was built in 1380, four years before the Bell Tower, making it the older sibling. It's 34 meters tall but sits on a higher platform, so it visually dominates the Bell Tower when you see them together. The architecture is "double-eave hip roof" like the Bell Tower, but the Drum Tower feels heavier, more grounded—fitting for a structure meant to signal the close of day.

Climb it (¥35, or ¥50 combo with Bell Tower—get the combo). At the top, you'll see China's largest drum: 2.83 meters in diameter, 3.43 meters tall, covered in cowhide. It's a 1996 replica—the original cracked centuries ago from thermal expansion. The broken original is displayed nearby, a testament to how even the best Ming Dynasty craftsmanship couldn't handle extreme temperature swings.

Drum performances happen daily (9am, 10am, 11am, 2:30pm, 3:30pm, 4:30pm, with extra shows on holidays). Performers in Ming-era costume beat the drums in synchronized rhythms—20 minutes of thunderous, visceral sound. The floor vibrates. Your chest vibrates. For a moment, you understand what it felt like when evening drums echoed across the city and everyone knew: time to go home, gates are closing, night watch begins.

Surrounding the main drum are 24 smaller drums, each representing one of the 24 solar terms (Start of Spring, Awakening of Insects, Grain Rain, etc.). Ancient Chinese agriculture relied on these divisions of the year, and the drums reminded people when to plant, harvest, and prepare for winter. The Drum Tower wasn't just a timekeeper—it was a calendar.

The view from the top splits Xi'an in two. North is the Muslim Quarter (Beiyuanmen and surrounding streets)—minarets, blue-tiled roofs, the smell of lamb and cumin rising on the breeze. South is the Bell Tower and the Han Chinese center—temples, government buildings, modern shopping districts. The Drum Tower stands on the cultural border, neither fully part of one nor the other, a symbolic gateway.

The tower itself has a small museum inside—Ming and Qing furniture, rosewood tables, carved screens, ivory boxes. The craftsmanship is ridiculous: carvings so fine you can see individual hair strands on tiny wooden figures hidden in the dougong brackets. These were craftsman signatures, proof of skill, hidden where only other craftsmen would look.

Below the Drum Tower, the Muslim Quarter begins. First-timers: it's a tourist street, prices are inflated, and half the stalls sell the same stuff. But it's also lively, chaotic, delicious, and historically significant. The Hui Muslim community has lived here for over 600 years. For authentic food, skip Beiyuanmen's main drag and duck into side streets—West Yangshi, Dapianyuan, Saojinqiao.

Recommended eats nearby: "Lao Sun's Lamb Pita" (Beiyuanmen 93)—the real thing, thick lamb soup with hand-torn bread soaking up flavor, ¥28. "Jia San's Soup Dumplings" (Beiyuanmen 131)—beef and lamb filling, thin skin, ¥8 for 8 dumplings, dangerously hot soup inside. "Ma Er's BBQ" (after 10pm, West Yangshi)—lamb skewers grilled over charcoal, ¥10 for 3, crispy fat and cumin crust.

The Great Mosque (Huajue Alley, off the main tourist drag) is 10 minutes north. It's one of China's oldest mosques, blending Chinese architectural style with Islamic function. Entry is ¥25, and non-Muslims can visit except during prayer times. The courtyard has an 800-year-old ginkgo tree that turns brilliant gold in autumn.

Evening is when the Drum Tower shines. At 8:30pm, floodlights turn it into a golden beacon. The Bell Tower, 300 meters east, lights up simultaneously, and between them, Beiyuanmen stretches as a river of neon, crowds, and street food smoke. Musicians sometimes perform in the square—guzheng, erhu, pipa—and the sound mixes with traffic, vendors shouting, and the distant call to prayer from the mosque.

One year, I was here during Mid-Autumn Festival. They held a moon-viewing ceremony with traditional music and dance. The square was packed, people standing shoulder-to-shoulder, but everyone fell silent when the drummers started. Twenty drummers, all in sync, pounding out a rhythm that echoed off the tower walls. When they finished, three seconds of silence, then applause that lasted five minutes. That's what this tower does—it turns noise into ritual, chaos into rhythm.

From here: north into the Muslim Quarter for food, south to Bell Tower and city wall, west to Saojinqiao (locals' food street, cheaper and less touristy), east to Shuyuanmen (antique street, calligraphy shops, quiet). The Drum Tower is a pivot point, the place where the city's different flavors meet.

Hours: 8:30am-8:30pm (winter closes earlier, around 6pm). Combo ticket with Bell Tower is the smart move. Visit Drum Tower first (fewer crowds), then Bell Tower, then wander into the Muslim Quarter for dinner. By the time you finish eating, both towers will be lit up, and you can photograph them against the night sky while nursing a food coma.
