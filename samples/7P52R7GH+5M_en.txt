# 👑 The Grand Palace – Heart of Rattanakosin
**Na Phra Lan Road, Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok**

Welcome, everyone. This is the Grand Palace, construction beginning with the founding of Rattanakosin in 1782 on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya River, formerly Mon and Lao communities. We'll walk through white walls over 1,900 meters long to touch the living heritage of the Chakri Dynasty.

## History and Architecture
- Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall blends colonial Italian base with Thai prang-style roofs, symbolizing King Rama V's era of opening to Western knowledge.
- Temple of the Emerald Buddha enshrines the Emerald Buddha carved from green jade during the Lan Xang period, with ceremonial robe changes three times yearly by the King.
- Stucco reliefs and glazed tiles in the gallery corridor tell 178 scenes of the Ramakien, painters using traditional mineral pigments mixed with fish glue.

## Natural Landscape
This side of the Chao Phraya receives westerly winds that ventilate the ceremonial courtyard. Tamalan and Peeb trees attract bees for pollination, while the inner emerald pond shelters bronze-winged jacanas and silver barb fish that old Bangkokians used to catch and eat. Building roofs use tiles that shed water quickly, reducing moisture accumulation in rainy season.

## Seasons and Weather
Thai cool season (November–February) brings mornings at 24°C, afternoons around 32°C, 60% humidity, and UV index still hitting 8 during 11 AM-2 PM. March to May temperatures can touch 36°C. Please bring folding umbrellas or wide-brimmed hats.

## Getting Here and Time Needed
- **MRT Sanam Chai Station (Blue Line)**: Exit 1, walk through City Museum, 8 minutes.
- **Chao Phraya Express Boat (Orange/Green flag)**: Tha Chang pier, 5 minute walk; frequency every 10-15 minutes.
- **Buses 3, 32, 508** stop at Sanam Luang, but avoid 7-9 AM rush.
- Allow minimum 90 minutes inside Grand Palace, plus 30 minutes for Temple of Emerald Buddha.

## Language and Community
This is the birthplace of standard Thai and royal Thai used in ceremonies. Guides say "sawatdee krap" with wai gesture, but you'll still hear Pathum or Mon accents from senior staff. Please dress respectfully to honor the rituals and ancestors of Bangkok people.

## Food and Traditions
After viewing the palace, visit Maharat Road for khao chae (palace recipe) or rad na with sea bass. Traditional coffee with palm sugar at Sukhothai restaurant still uses clay-roasted methods. Thursday evenings, there's long drum rehearsal and dance before the City Pillar Shrine—free to photograph but offer thanks in Thai.

## Family Suggestions
- Children under 120 cm height receive free admission but must dress properly.
- Free cold water point beside Sala Rachadamnoen; bring personal bottles to reduce plastic.
- Restrooms and nursing room located at Audience Hall Building, signs in Thai, English, and Braille.
- Strollers allowed only in central courtyard; use sun cover cloths.

## Continuing Routes
Exit Wisutkkasat Gate and walk 6 minutes to National Museum Bangkok, or cross the river to Thonburi side to visit Wat Arun, just 10 minutes by boat. I'll guide you all through the ticket checkpoint now. Please maintain walking pace and follow my voice.
