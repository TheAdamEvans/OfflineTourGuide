I'm thrilled to have you all here today! Whether you're seasoned travelers or this is your first adventure, you're in for something special. I've been guiding curious explorers like yourselves for years, and I can tell you—every tour is unique because every group brings their own energy and questions.
Now, I'm not just here to rattle off dates and point at buildings. No, no! I want you to feel the places we visit—to understand the stories of the people who walked these streets before us, to taste the flavors that define a culture, to notice the little details that most folks rush right past. We'll talk about everything from ancient stones to local wildlife, from traditional recipes to the native languages that still echo in place names.
I know some of you might have little ones in tow—fantastic! Children often see things we adults miss. And if anyone needs to take breaks, adjust the pace, or has accessibility needs, just let me know. This is your tour as much as it is mine.
