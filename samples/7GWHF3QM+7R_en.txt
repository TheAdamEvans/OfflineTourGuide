# 🏺 The Egyptian Museum – Where Kings Sleep With One Eye Open
**Tahrir Square, Qasr El Nil, Cairo**

Welcome! This pink building in front of you? 123 years old and holding **170,000 pieces**. 120,000 of them are stuffed in the basement because there's no room to display them.

This isn't a museum. **It's an organized warehouse of eternity.**

## The Mask That Fooled the Thieves

Everyone comes for Tutankhamun. The famous golden mask—11 kilograms of solid gold and lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. Beautiful? Yes. But that's not the interesting part.

**The interesting part?** Tut was a failed pharaoh. Died at 19. Did nothing important. But his tomb was **the only one** ancient thieves never found. Why? Because they buried Ramesses VI on top of him 200 years later. The thieves ransacked Ramesses' tomb and never knew another lay beneath their feet.

**Failure saved the treasure.**

The mask room gets mobbed between 11:00-14:00. Go at opening (09:00) or after 16:00. Trust me—seeing the mask without 300 people taking selfies is a completely different experience.

## The Royal Mummy Room (And the Secrets It Hides)

Upstairs. Separate ticket (200 EGP). **Worth every piaster.**

Ramesses II—the pharaoh who lived 90 years and fathered over 100 children—lies here. His hair still reddish from henna. His fingernails intact. And if you look closely (no touching!), you can see **the smile line on his lips**. After 3,200 years, he still looks pleased with himself.

**Something they don't tell you:** Ramesses' mummy was found in a cache with 40 others. Ancient priests, terrified of thieves, collected all the kings and hid them in a secret shaft at Deir el-Bahari. Body upon body. **Ancient Egypt's elite, stacked like firewood.**

In 1881, when archaeologists found it, local farmers had known about it for decades and been selling artifacts piece by piece. Everyone's secret treasure.

## The Statues That Blink

Don't miss the **Seated Scribe** statue (Ground floor, Room 32). His eyes are made of rock crystal and copper strips. In certain light, **he appears to look straight at you**.

These statues were built to house the soul of the deceased. So when you feel their eyes following you? That's exactly the point.

## Heat and Time

November in Cairo: 18-26°C daytime, 14°C at night. **The sun is merciful, but UV rays are strong—wear sunscreen.** The Nile 400 meters away sends a humid western breeze in the afternoon.

In summer (May-June)? Over 36°C. The museum's vintage air conditioning struggles. Visit mornings or suffer.

The front garden is planted with **ficus and sycamore trees**—an extension of ancient Egypt's sacred trees. Ancient Egyptians buried their dead beneath sycamores because they believed gods dwelled in them. **The trees here are guardians.**

## How to Get Here

**Metro Lines 1 & 2 (Sadat Station)**: Two direct exits to Tahrir Square. From platform to museum in 5 minutes. Cheapest way (5 EGP).

**Buses 400 & 502**: From Nasr City and Maadi. Expect crowds 8-10 AM.

**Walking from Corniche**: 7 minutes from Qasr El Nil Bridge. The Nile view is worth the walk.

Budget **2 hours for main exhibits**, 3 hours with the Mummy Room. **Free entry for Egyptian students** (university card), 200 EGP for foreigners.

## Languages of Death and Life

Cairo today speaks Egyptian Arabic. Labels show **ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and Coptic**. Some guides offer tours in **Nubian** honoring the southern peoples who built the temples.

Say "salaam alaikum" and "shukran" to the security guards. They know things that don't appear in guidebooks. Once I asked one about a small statue. He told me: "This is where pharaoh cries." **He was right—the inscription shows tiny tears.**

## After the Museum?

**Tahrir Koshary**: 3 minutes away. Rice, lentils, pasta, tomato sauce, crispy onions. Egyptian street food at its finest. Cheap, filling, delicious.

**Foul and ta'ameya** from Qudura restaurant on Champollion Street: The breakfast Egyptians have eaten for thousands of years (literally—they found fava bean remains in pharaonic tombs).

**Nearby Groppi Café**: Iced karkade and **basbousa with cream**. Semolina cake with syrup and cream. Narcotic.

Thursday evenings, a youth band plays pharaonic melodies with Upper Egyptian rhythms in the central hall. **Tradition meets innovation.**

## Final Tip

There's a **nursing room** (East Wing) with sink and microwave. Strollers allowed on ground floor only; upper floor requires a small glass elevator.

**"Discover the Scribe" activity cards** free for children 7-12. They love them.

**Stay 50 cm away from glass cases**—some sensors are sensitive to any vibration.

---

This building isn't just a museum. It's **an above-ground necropolis.** The kings who ruled here rest here. Their crystal eyes watch. Their faint smiles endure.

When you walk among the sarcophagi, remember: all these people believed they would live forever. **And in the end, they did—just not in the way they expected.**

Let's go inside. The kings are waiting. 👑
