# 🏛️ Queen Victoria Building (QVB)
**George Street, Sydney CBD - Heart of Gadigal Country**

G'day everyone! Welcome to one of Sydney's absolute crown jewels - the magnificent Queen Victoria Building, or as we locals affectionately call it, the QVB. 

**The Story:**
Standing before you is a masterpiece of Romanesque Revival architecture, designed by George McRae and completed in 1898. But here's the beautiful part of this story - this wasn't built by some wealthy merchant. It was constructed during the depression of the 1890s specifically to employ skilled craftsmen, stonemasons, and artisans who desperately needed work. Every intricate detail you see was lovingly crafted by hands that needed the labour. It was named to honour Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.

**What to Look For:**
Take a moment to look up - WAY up! That central dome soars 30 metres above us, topped with a stunning copper-sheathed roof that's weathered to that gorgeous green patina. Notice the exquisite stained glass windows, the elaborate tile work, and the cast-iron balustrades on each level. The building stretches an entire city block - 190 metres long!

Don't miss the two extraordinary clocks: The **Royal Clock** on the ground floor features six scenes of English royalty on the hour, while upstairs, the **Great Australian Clock** tells the story of Australian history in 33 moving scenes - it's hypnotic!

**Today:**
After nearly being demolished in the 1960s (can you imagine?!), the QVB was lovingly restored in the 1980s and now houses nearly 200 boutique shops, cafes, and restaurants across four levels. It's the perfect spot to grab a flat white, browse for souvenirs, or simply sit and soak in the atmosphere.

**Next Steps:**
From here, we're just a 3-minute walk to Town Hall and the beautiful St. Andrew's Cathedral, or if you're feeling peckish, the laneways of the CBD's cafe culture are all around us. We could also head 5 minutes down to Darling Harbour for harbour views!
