Right, so everyone calls it Big Ben, but that's actually the bell inside. The tower's officially the Elizabeth Tower since 2012. I'll still call it Big Ben because I'm not a monster.

It's 316 feet of Victorian Gothic gorgeousness, finished in 1859 after a fire destroyed the old Palace of Westminster. Augustus Pugin designed it—same bloke who went a bit mad and died at 40. The clock faces are 23 feet across. The minute hands alone are 14 feet long and made of copper.

Best spot to see it? Westminster Bridge at twilight, around 8pm in summer. The light's perfect, the Thames reflects the tower, and you can hear the bells properly. Each chime weighs 13 tons, and when it strikes the hour, you feel it in your chest. I've stood here in February rain and August heatwaves—it's magnificent either way, but spring's lovely when the trees along the Embankment bloom.

The bells still work mechanically, wound three times a week. During WWII, they kept chiming through the Blitz. Proper stiff upper lip and all that.

Westminster station's right there—District, Circle, and Jubilee lines. Pop out, see the tower, then walk 5 minutes south along the river to Lambeth Bridge for a different angle. Or cross Westminster Bridge and get the London Eye in your photo too if you're feeling touristy.

For food, skip the overpriced cafés around Parliament Square. Walk 7 minutes to The Cockpit on St. Andrew's Street—£8 fish and chips that'll ruin all other fish and chips for you. Or there's a Pret on Victoria Street for a quick £4 sandwich.

The tower's under renovation until 2025, covered in scaffolding, but honestly it's still worth it. The clockwork's visible through the scaffolding now, which is rather brilliant if you're into engineering.

If you fancy seeing inside, UK residents can book tours through their MP. Tourists are out of luck until renovations finish. The 334-step climb up the narrow spiral staircase is properly knackering, but my mate who did it said the view's breathtaking.

After, walk 10 minutes to the Churchill War Rooms or grab a drink at The Red Lion pub on Whitehall—£6 pints, proper British pub, been there since 1782. Bus 159 or 11 will take you up to Trafalgar Square if your feet need a rest.
